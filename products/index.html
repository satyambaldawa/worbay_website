                    <h2>Fire Extinguishers</h2>

                    <p>A fire extinguisher is an active fire protection device used to extinguish or control small
                        fires, often in emergency situations. It is not intended for use on an out-of-control fire, such
                        as one which has reached the ceiling, endangers the user (i.e., no escape route, smoke,
                        explosion hazard, etc.), or otherwise requires the expertise of a fire department. Typically, a
                        fire extinguisher consists of a hand-held cylindrical pressure vessel containing an agent which
                        can be discharged to extinguish a fire. Fire extinguishers manufactured with non-cylindrical
                        pressure vessels also exist, but are less common. There are two main types of fire
                        extinguishers: stored-pressure and cartridge-operated. In stored pressure units, the expellant
                        is stored in the same chamber as the firefighting agent itself.
                        <span class="abc fireExtinguisher"> Depending on the agent used,
                        different propellants are used. With dry chemical extinguishers, nitrogen is typically used;
                        water and foam extinguishers typically use air. Stored pressure fire extinguishers are the most
                        common type. Cartridge-operated extinguishers contain the expellant gas in a separate cartridge
                        that is punctured prior to discharge, exposing the propellant to the extinguishing agent. This
                        type is not as common, used primarily in areas such as industrial facilities, where they receive
                        higher-than-average use. They have the advantage of simple and prompt recharge, allowing an
                        operator to discharge the extinguisher, recharge it, and return to the fire in a reasonable
                        amount of time. Unlike stored pressure types, these extinguishers use compressed carbon dioxide
                        instead of nitrogen, although nitrogen cartridges are used on low temperature (-60 rated)
                        models. Cartridge operated extinguishers are available in dry chemical and dry powder types in
                        the U.S. and in water, wetting agent, foam, dry chemical (classes ABC and B.C.), and dry powder
                        (class D) types in the rest of the world.


                        Fire extinguishers are further divided into handheld and cart-mounted (also called wheeled
                        extinguishers). Handheld extinguishers weigh from 0.5 to 14 kilograms (1.1 to 30.9 lb), and are
                        hence, easily portable by hand. Cart-mounted units typically weigh more than 23 kilograms (51
                        lb). These wheeled models are most commonly found at construction sites, airport runways,
                        heliports, as well as docks and marinas.</span></p>

                    <h2>Smoke Detector / Heat Detector</h2>

                    <p>A smoke detector is a device that senses smoke, typically as an indicator of fire. Commercial
                        security devices issue a signal to a fire alarm control panel as part of a fire alarm system,
                        while household smoke detectors, also known as smoke alarms, generally issue a local audible or
                        visual alarm from the detector itself. Smoke can be detected either optically (photoelectric) or
                        by physical process (ionization), detectors may use either, or both, methods. Sensitive alarms
                        can be used to detect, and thus deter, smoking in areas where it is banned. Smoke detectors in
                        large commercial, industrial, and residential buildings are usually powered by a central fire
                        alarm system, which is powered by the building power with a battery backup.
                        <span class="abc smokeDetector"> Domestic smoke detectors range from individual battery-powered units,
                            to several interlinked mains-powered units with battery backup; with these interlinked units,
                            if any unit detects smoke, all trigger even if household power has gone out.</span>

                        is the controlling component of a fire alarm system. The panel receives information from devices
                        designed to detect and report fires, monitors their operational integrity and provides for
                        automatic control of equipment, and transmission of information necessary to prepare the
                        facility for fire based on a predetermined sequence. The panel may also supply electrical energy
                        to operate any associated initiating device, notification appliance, control, transmitter, or
                        relay. There are four basic types of panels: coded panels, conventional panels, addressable
                        panels, and multiplex systems

                    <p>Fire hydrant pump systems (also known as fire pumps, hydrant boosters, fire water pumps) are
                        high-pressure water pumps designed to increase the firefighting capacity of a building by
                        boosting the pressure in the hydrant service when mains is not enough, or when tank fed. In a
                        building, a fire hydrant system is a safety measure or emergency equipment required in some

                    <p>A courtyard or court is a circumscribed area, often surrounded by a building or complex, that is
                        open to the sky. Such spaces in inns and public buildings were often the primary meeting places
                        for some purposes, leading to the other meanings of court. Both of the words court and yard
                        derive from the same root, meaning an enclosed space. See yard and garden for the relation of
                        this set of words.

                        steam. The pump intake is either connected to the public underground water supply piping, or a
                        static water source (e.g., tank, reservoir, lake). The pump provides water flow at a higher
                        pressure to the sprinkler system risers and hose standpipes.<br> A fire pump is tested and
                        listed for its use specifically for fire service by a third-party testing and listing agency,
                        such as UL or FM Global.Fire pumps function either by an electric motor or a diesel engine, or,
                        occasionally a steam turbine. If the local building code requires power <span

                    <h2>Gas Suppression</h2>

                    <p>Gas Suppression Systems : Fire Protection Gas Suppression System or simply called Automatic Fire
                        Suppression System (or Gas Suppression System), is relatively a new technology in India. Unlike
                        the conventional system that uses water, in Gas Based Fire Suppression System; water is never
                        used and yet the fire is extinguished. Here Gas is used to extinguish the fire. Hence it is a
                        Gas Based system. The fire gets extinguished, within a minute of activation and everything is
                        automatic.
                        <br>
                        Is it always necessary to provide Fire Protection with Gas Suppression System? Or Why go for a
                        Gas Suppression System? - Absolutely not. In certain areas like Server Systems, Art Galleries or
                        near delicate machinery, water can cause more and permanent damage than the fire. <span
                                class="abc gasSuppression"> In the Server Room, the data in the server is more costly than
                            the server itself. If the art piece or data, gets damaged or lost; it would result in an immeasurable loss. <br>

                        How do Gas Suppression System Function? - Gas Suppression Systems are generally used in concealed rooms.
                            The principle used by Gas Suppression System is by breaking the Fire Triangle, the fire ceases to exist.
                            In the room, protected by Gas Suppression System, there are various detectors placed at various locations.
                            Each detector constantly monitors the room for signs of fire. As soon as the fire is detected, an alarm is sounded,
                            to the personnel to evacuate the entire room. Then, the gas like, Novec, Clean Agent or Co2 is released in the enclosed room.
                            Thus, the oxygen in the room is rapidly reduced, to a level where fire cannot exist. However, living organisms remain unharmed,
                            because of the gas. Because of such a system, all the delicate or critical items remain untouched and unharmed by fire or water.

                    <p>A fire sprinkler system is an active fire protection method, consisting of a water supply system,
                        providing adequate pressure and flowrate to a water distribution piping system, onto which fire
                        sprinklers are connected. Although historically only used in factories and large commercial
                        buildings, systems for homes and small buildings are now available at a cost-effective price.
                        Fire sprinkler systems are extensively used worldwide, with over 40 million sprinkler heads
                        fitted each year. In buildings completely protected by fire sprinkler systems, over 96% of fires
                        were controlled by fire sprinklers alone.

                    <p>A gas detector is a device that detects the presence of gases in an area, often as part of a
                        safety system. This type of equipment is used to detect a gas leak or other emissions and can
                        interface with a control system so a process can be automatically shut down. A gas detector can
                        sound an alarm to operators in the area where the leak is occurring, giving them the opportunity
                        to leave. This type of device is important because there are many gases that can be harmful to
                        organic life, such as humans or animals. Gas detectors can be used to detect combustible,
                        flammable and toxic gases and oxygen depletion. <span
                                class="abc gasLeak">This type of device is used widely in industry and can be found in locations, such as on oil rigs, to monitor manufacture processes and emerging technologies such as photovoltaic. They may be used in firefighting.
